Hi! This is Muhtasim Ahmed Adil. Some people call me "Muhtasim", some call me "Adil", some call me "Invincible". 

I'm currently majoring in Computer Science at Brac University, BD. Hoping to graduate by Dec, 2024 with a good CGPA and some great achievements. I'm heavily interested in DeFi, learning something new each day. I think, it's the future of financial systems worldwide.

I started to learn coding when I was in class 9. In my middle school and high school days I used to participate in national level Competitive Programming contests, did a few national camps. Even though competitive programming journey hasn't been much fruitful for me, I met a lot of like-minded people through this and learned a lot. 

I aspire to work as a Software Engineer or a Product Manager for a good product at a good company. I'm still exploring. Before that, I want to pursue master's degree in a CS domain from a North American university(fingers crossed). I have a slight wish to do an MBA as well. But plans are plans, they never come out as reality. But hey, who's stopping us from dreaming?

In my spare time, I worry about society and don't do anything about it. I like to take long walks, occasionally run, and like to think I have a good taste in music.
